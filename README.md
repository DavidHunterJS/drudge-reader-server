# Drudge Reader

Drudge Reader is a dynamic web application that scrapes the current news stories from the Drudge Report website. This tool not only updates the links in real-time but also enhances the user experience by providing additional features such as link previews and an integrated discussion forum.

## Features

- **Real-Time Link Updates:** The application continuously scrapes the Drudge Report to provide users with the latest news stories as they are posted.
- **Link Previews:** Hovering over a news link displays a screenshot of the corresponding webpage, giving users a quick preview of the content.
- **Integrated Chat Forum:** Users can discuss news stories they care about in a dedicated forum powered by Flarum, a modern and fast forum software.
